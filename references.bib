abstract = {{We present a comprehensive study on the extraction of CFT data using tensor network methods, specially, from the fixed-point tensor of the linearized tensor renormalization group (lTRG) for the 2D classical Ising model near the critical temperature. Utilizing two different methods, we extract operator scaling dimensions and operator-product-expansion (OPE) coefficients by introducing defects on the lattice and by employing the fixed-point tensor. We also explore the effects of point-like defects in the lattice on the coarse-graining process. We find that there is a correspondence between coarse-grained defect tensors and conformal states obtained from lTRG fixed-point equation. We also analyze the capabilities and limitations of our proposed coarse-graining scheme for tensor networks with point-like defects, which includes graph independent local truncation (GILT) and higher-order tensor renormalization group (HOTRG). Our results provide a better understanding of the capacity and limitations of the tenor renormalization group scheme in coarse-graining defect tensors, and we show that GILT+HOTRG can be used to give accurate two- and four-point functions under specific conditions. We also find that employing the minimal canonical form further improves the stability of the RG flow.}},

	abstract = {© 2017 ACM. There is an increasing interest in learning outside of the traditional classroom setting. This is especially true for topics covering computational tools and data science, as both are challenging to incorporate in the standard curriculum. These atypical learning environments offer new opportunities for teaching, particularly when it comes to combining conceptual knowledge with hands-on experience/expertise with methods and skills. Advances in cloud computing and containerized environments provide an attractive opportunity to improve the effciency and ease with which students can learn. This manuscript details recent advances towards using commonly-Available cloud computing services and advanced cyberinfrastructure support for improving the learning experience in bootcamp-style events. We cover the benets (and challenges) of using a server hosted remotely instead of relying on student laptops, discuss the technology that was used in order to make this possible, and give suggestions for how others could implement and improve upon this model for pedagogy and reproducibility.},

	abstract = {© 2017 Holdgraf, Rieger, Micheli, Martin, Knight and Theunissen. Cognitive neuroscience has seen rapid growth in the size and complexity of data recorded from the human brain as well as in the computational tools available to analyze this data. This data explosion has resulted in an increased use of multivariate, model-based methods for asking neuroscience questions, allowing scientists to investigate multiple hypotheses with a single dataset, to use complex, time-varying stimuli, and to study the human brain under more naturalistic conditions. These tools come in the form of “Encoding” models, in which stimulus features are used to model brain activity, and “Decoding” models, in which neural features are used to generated a stimulus output. Here we review the current state of encoding and decoding models in cognitive electrophysiology and provide a practical guide toward conducting experiments and analyses in this emerging field. Our examples focus on using linear models in the study of human language and audition. We show how to calculate auditory receptive fields from natural sounds as well as how to decode neural recordings to predict speech. The paper aims to be a useful tutorial to these approaches, and a practical introduction to using machine learning and applied statistics to build models of neural activity. The data analytic approaches we discuss may also be applied to other sensory modalities, motor systems, and cognitive systems, and we cover some examples in these areas. In addition, a collection of Jupyter notebooks is publicly available as a complement to the material covered in this paper, providing code examples and tutorials for predictive modeling in python. The aimis to provide a practical understanding of predictivemodeling of human brain data and to propose best-practices in conducting these analyses.},
